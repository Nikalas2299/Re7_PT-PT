Resident Evil 7 - In European Portuguese (PT-PT) - Not only translated but also located and adapted.

This mod is only for the original version of the game DirectX 11.

Being Resident Evil an horror games series, and being one of the most important features in this type of games the imersion that it can provide, and being myself Portuguese I never saw any game of this franchise be fully immersive.

That's why I decided to translate and locate the game in Portuguese, based in the original English and some Brazilian Portuguese's texts from the game.

The translation is only available for the DirectX 11 version of the game, but I hope to do all the versions.

If it's your first time playing the game and you are wondering if you can still get achievements like as in the steam base version, the answer is YES. The game works just as the unmoded version.

THIS IS A BACKUP UPLOAD - IF YOU'RE SEEING THIS NEXUS MOD HAS SOME SORT OF ERROR
